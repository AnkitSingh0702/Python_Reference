# 1---> FOR LOOP IS USED WHEN WE KNOW HOW MANY TIMES WE  HAVE  TO ITERARTE
# the for loop in python is used to iterate over a sequence list,tuple,string iterating over a sequence is called traversal
# for x in range(10):
#  print(2*x, end= " --> ")   

#  iterated in string, List
# Doing with list
# a  = ['Ankit']
# for name in a: 
#     print(name*2)


# 2---> WHILE LOOP is used to iterate overa a block of code as lond as text expression is true 
#n = 5
#while n >= 0: # we can check wheather it is greater than 0 then we can print n but from next line we have to substract 1
    #print(n)
    #n -= 1
